# How to change the working days and hours in the Flutter Calendar?

A quick-start example to help you to change the working days and hours in the Flutter Calendar.

You can display the required duration in the Flutter Event Calendar by using the [startHour](https://pub.dev/documentation/syncfusion_flutter_calendar/latest/calendar/TimeSlotViewSettings/startHour.html) and [endHour](https://pub.dev/documentation/syncfusion_flutter_calendar/latest/calendar/TimeSlotViewSettings/endHour.html) properties in TimeSlotViewSettings. You can also use the [nonWorkingDays](https://pub.dev/documentation/syncfusion_flutter_calendar/latest/calendar/TimeSlotViewSettings/nonWorkingDays.html) property to change the non-working days of the week according to your requirements.
